| 前言： | Preface: |
| 教育是提升國民福祉的重要基石，而發展「教育幸福」更是促進國民幸福的必要手段。聯合國永續發展目標（Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs）第4項主張「確保有教無類、全民且高品質的教育，並提倡終身學習」。經濟合作暨發展組織（OECD）於2019年提出「2030學習羅盤（Learning Compass 2030）」，界定學習者應具備的知識、技能、態度與價值觀，以發揮潛能，並為社區與地球福祉作出貢獻。由此可見，從新課綱核心素養與學習羅盤的觀點出發，我們期待學生不僅具備知識與技能，亦能培養正確的態度與價值觀，朝向參與學習、幸福生活的終極目標前進。因此，學校校務系統需在共同體、環境、資源與效能等層面更有效運作，以支持學校發展；其完整架構可由六個面向加以描繪，說明如下： | Education is the cornerstone of improving national well-being, and developing "educational happiness" is a necessary means to promote national happiness. The Goal 4,  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) advocates "ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all." The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) proposed the "Learning Compass 2030" in 2019, defining the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values that learners should possess to fulfill their potential and contribute to the well-being of their communities and the planet. From the perspective of the new curriculum's core competencies and the Learning Compass, we expect students not only to have knowledge and skills but also to cultivate correct attitudes and values, moving towards the ultimate goal of participating in learning and living a happy life. Therefore, the school's administrative system needs to operate more effectively in terms of community, environment, resources, and efficiency to support school development. Its complete framework can be depicted in the following six aspects: |

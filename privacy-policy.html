                <p>Despite our comprehensive security measures, no system is completely immune to security breaches.

                <p>While TCVS implements comprehensive security measures to protect information within our control, we also recognize that security is a shared responsibility. We encourage all users to take appropriate precautions to protect their own information and accounts. Users should create strong, unique passwords for school accounts and avoid sharing passwords with others. Enable multi-factor authentication when available for enhanced account security. Be cautious of phishing emails and suspicious communications claiming to be from the school; verify the authenticity of unexpected requests for personal information. Keep personal devices and software updated with the latest security patches. Use secure, password-protected Wi-Fi connections when accessing school systems, especially when dealing with sensitive information. Log out of school systems and close browser windows when finished, particularly on shared or public computers. Report any suspicious activities, security concerns, or potential data breaches to the school's IT department immediately. Regularly review account activity and notify the school of any unauthorized access or unusual activity. Educate children about online safety and appropriate sharing of personal information. By working together and following these best practices, we can create a more secure digital environment for our entire school community.</p>

                <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 30px;">17. Data Processing and Transfer Mechanisms</h2>
                <p>Understanding how personal information flows through our systems and the safeguards we implement during processing and transfer is essential for transparency and accountability. This section provides detailed information about our data processing activities, transfer mechanisms, and protection measures.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: 20px;">17.1 Data Processing Principles</h3>
                <p>TCVS processes personal information in accordance with fundamental data protection principles that guide all our data handling activities. We adhere to the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, ensuring that we process data only when we have a valid legal basis and communicate our practices clearly to individuals. The principle of purpose limitation requires us to collect personal information for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not process it in ways incompatible with those purposes. We follow the principle of data minimization, collecting only the personal information that is adequate, relevant, and necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The principle of accuracy requires us to take reasonable steps to ensure personal information is accurate and kept up to date, and we promptly correct or delete inaccurate data upon identification or request.</p>

                <p>We observe the principle of storage limitation, retaining personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law, after which we securely delete or anonymize the information. The principle of integrity and confidentiality obligates us to process personal information in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. Finally, the principle of accountability requires us to take responsibility for complying with data protection principles and demonstrate our compliance through documentation, policies, and regular assessments.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: 20px;">17.2 Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
                <p>We process personal information only when we have a valid legal basis under applicable data protection laws. The legal bases for our processing activities include consent, where individuals have given clear and informed consent for us to process their personal information for specific purposes; contractual necessity, where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the individual or to take steps at the individual's request before entering into a contract; legal obligation, where processing is necessary for compliance with legal obligations to which TCVS is subject; vital interests, where processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of individuals or others; public task, where processing is necessary for the performance of tasks carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in TCVS as an educational institution; and legitimate interests, where processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by TCVS or third parties, provided such interests are not overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.</p>

                <p>For students under the age of 18, we recognize that additional protections apply, and we typically rely on legal bases such as parental consent, contractual necessity for educational services, or legitimate interests that align with the best interests of the child. We ensure that our processing activities for children's data are conducted with enhanced safeguards and transparency, and we respect the rights of parents and guardians to oversee the processing of their children's personal information.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: 20px;">17.3 Cross-Border Data Transfers</h3>
                <p>In today's interconnected digital environment, personal information may occasionally be transferred across international borders to facilitate our operations, utilize cloud services, or collaborate with international partners. When such transfers occur, TCVS implements appropriate safeguards to ensure that personal information receives adequate protection regardless of where it is processed or stored. We conduct transfer impact assessments to evaluate the adequacy of data protection in destination countries, considering factors such as local privacy laws, government surveillance practices, and available legal remedies for individuals.</p>

                <p>Our safeguards for international data transfers include selecting service providers and partners in countries recognized as providing adequate data protection standards; implementing standard contractual clauses approved by relevant data protection authorities that establish binding obligations on data recipients; utilizing binding corporate rules for transfers within affiliated organizations; obtaining explicit consent from individuals for specific transfers when appropriate; ensuring that transfers are necessary for important public interests or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; and conducting regular reviews of international transfer arrangements to ensure ongoing compliance with evolving legal requirements and best practices.</p>

                <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 30px;">18. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h2>
                <p>TCVS is committed to transparency regarding any automated decision-making processes or profiling activities that may affect individuals. As an educational institution, our use of automated processing is limited and primarily focused on administrative efficiency and educational quality improvement.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: 20px;">18.1 Limited Use of Automated Processing</h3>
                <p>We may use automated systems for certain administrative tasks such as initial screening of admissions applications based on objective criteria, automatic grade calculation and GPA computation, scheduling algorithms that assign students to classes based on preferences and availability, and automated alerts for attendance patterns or academic performance concerns that may require intervention. These automated processes are designed to support human decision-making rather than replace it entirely. Significant decisions affecting students, such as admissions outcomes, disciplinary actions, or academic progression, always involve human review and judgment by qualified educators and administrators.</p>

                <p>When automated systems are used, we ensure they operate based on fair and transparent criteria, are regularly reviewed for accuracy and bias, include mechanisms for human oversight and intervention, and respect individuals' rights to challenge automated decisions and request human review. We do not engage in automated decision-making that produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects individuals without appropriate safeguards, human involvement, and the right to appeal.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: 20px;">18.2 Educational Analytics and Profiling</h3>
                <p>We may conduct educational analytics using aggregated or pseudonymized student data to identify trends, evaluate program effectiveness, and improve educational outcomes. Such analytics may involve analyzing patterns in academic performance, course completion rates, engagement levels, or progression pathways to inform curriculum development, identify students who may benefit from additional support, and allocate resources effectively. These analytics activities are conducted in accordance with ethical principles, respect for individual privacy, and compliance with applicable laws.</p>

                <p>When conducting analytics that could be considered profiling, we implement safeguards including anonymization or pseudonymization of data whenever possible to prevent identification of individuals; aggregation of data to analyze group trends rather than individual characteristics; limitation of access to analytics results to authorized personnel with legitimate educational purposes; transparent communication with students and families about how data is used for educational improvement; and respect for individuals' rights to understand, question, and object to profiling activities. We do not use profiling for discriminatory purposes or in ways that could unfairly disadvantage individuals or groups.</p>

                <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 30px;">19. Special Categories of Personal Information</h2>
                <p>Certain types of personal information are considered particularly sensitive and require enhanced protection measures. TCVS handles special categories of personal information with the utmost care and only when necessary for legitimate educational purposes.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: 20px;">19.1 Definition and Examples</h3>
                <p>Special categories of personal information, also known as sensitive personal data, include information that reveals or relates to racial or ethnic origin; religious or philosophical beliefs; political opinions; trade union membership; genetic data; biometric data used for identification purposes; physical or mental health information; information about sexual orientation or sexual life; and criminal conviction records or information about alleged offenses. In an educational context, we may process certain special categories of information such as health information relevant to providing appropriate educational accommodations or medical care, information about learning disabilities or special educational needs, dietary restrictions or preferences related to religious or health requirements, and emergency medical information necessary for student safety.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: 20px;">19.2 Enhanced Protection Measures</h3>
                <p>When processing special categories of personal information, we implement enhanced protection measures including obtaining explicit consent from individuals or their legal guardians when required by law; limiting processing to situations where it is necessary for substantial public interest in education, health or safety reasons, or compliance with legal obligations; restricting access to sensitive information to authorized personnel with specific need and appropriate training; applying additional technical and organizational security measures such as encryption, access logging, and segregated storage; conducting privacy impact assessments before initiating new processing activities involving sensitive data; and providing individuals with clear information about why we process sensitive information and their rights regarding such processing. We regularly review our handling of special categories of personal information to ensure compliance with legal requirements and alignment with best practices for protecting sensitive data.</p>

                <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 30px;">20. Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
                <p>Beyond the basic rights outlined earlier in this Policy, data protection laws provide individuals with comprehensive rights regarding their personal information. This section expands on these rights and explains how you can exercise them.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: 20px;">20.1 Right to Be Informed</h3>
                <p>You have the right to be informed about the collection and use of your personal information. This Privacy Policy serves as our primary means of fulfilling this obligation by providing clear and comprehensive information about our data practices. We ensure that information is provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. When collecting personal information directly from you, we provide information about our identity and contact details, the purposes for which we process the information, the legal basis for processing, with whom we share the information, and your rights regarding the information. When we obtain personal information from other sources, we provide similar information within a reasonable period, typically within one month.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: 20px;">20.2 Right to Rectification and Erasure</h3>
                <p>You have the right to have inaccurate personal information corrected and incomplete personal information completed. If you identify errors or omissions in the information we hold about you, please notify us, and we will promptly investigate and make necessary corrections. In certain circumstances, you also have the right to erasure of your personal information, sometimes referred to as the "right to be forgotten." This right applies when personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected; you withdraw consent on which processing is based and there is no other legal ground for processing; you object to processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for continued processing; personal information has been unlawfully processed; or erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation. However, the right to erasure is not absolute, and we may refuse requests when processing is necessary for compliance with legal obligations, for reasons of public interest in education, for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or for archiving purposes in the public interest.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: 20px;">20.3 Right to Restriction and Objection</h3>
                <p>You have the right to restrict processing of your personal information in certain circumstances, such as when you contest the accuracy of the information and we need time to verify accuracy; the processing is unlawful but you prefer restriction over erasure; we no longer need the information but you require it for legal claims; or you have objected to processing and we need to verify whether our legitimate grounds override your interests. When processing is restricted, we may only store the information and must inform you before lifting the restriction. You also have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes. When you object to processing for direct marketing, we will cease such processing immediately. For objections based on your particular situation, we will cease processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing is necessary for legal claims.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: 20px;">20.4 Right to Data Portability</h3>
                <p>You have the right to receive personal information you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit that information to another organization without hindrance. This right applies when processing is based on consent or contract and is carried out by automated means. Where technically feasible, you can request that we transmit the information directly to another organization. The right to data portability complements your rights to access and erasure but does not extend to all personal information we hold about you—only to information you have actively provided to us.</p>

                <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 30px;">21. Conclusion and Commitment</h2>
